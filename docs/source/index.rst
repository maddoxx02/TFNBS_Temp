Welcome to TFNBS's documentation!
=================================

TFNBS Toolbox is a Python package for computation and generation of network-based statistics for neuroscience data 
(i.e. fMRI, EEG data). The core concept is based on eliminating the use of a hardcoded threshold using threshold-free 
cluster enhancement (TFCE) scores to assess statistical significance. It works on the principle of networks, where TFCE 
statistical values are computed across a range of thresholds over n cycles of permutations to uncover possible significance in the data.
